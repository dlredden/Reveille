			<h3>Benefits of time management</h3>
			<p class="quotation">"Time is what we want most, but what we use worst."<br>-William Penn</p>
			<p>Knowing how we spend our time helps make us more productive, and lets us know when we need to find balance. We hope Reveille will help you stop wasting time managing your schedule, so you can spend more time investing it in yourself.</p>

			<h3>What inspired Reveille?</h3>
			<p>We use 37signal's Backpack and Basecamp to keep our schedules and projects organized, and we wanted a simple way to see all of our calendar and task data in one place.  So, we set out to solve our own problem.  We thought maybe there were other teams out there with the same problem so we decided to make Reveille available to everyone.</p>
