		<h2 class="faq-h2">Here are the answers to a few common questions about Reveille ...</h2>
		<div id="what-is-backpack" class="left">
			<h3>What is Backpack?</h3>
			<p>Backpack is a web based organization tool created by <%= link_to "37signals", "http://www.37signals.com"%>.  You can share information with your team or family, and keep important documents, discussions, and schedules in one place.  We personally use it and love it, and we think you will too.<br><%= link_to "Click to learn more, or to get a Backpack account.", "http://backpackit.com/?referrer=WIKIDLABS"%></p>

		<div id="why-build-reveille" class="left">
			<h3>Why did you create Reveille?</h3>
			<p>We use Backpack ourselves, and we found the built-in 30 minute reminders for the calendar to be too limiting.  So, we decided to do something about it.  We built Reveille to provide an easy way for us to add and manage reminders.  We loved using it so much we decided to make it available to you.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="how-much-cost" class="left">
			<h3>What are your pricing plans?</h3>
			<p>We will reveal specifics when Reveille becomes publicly available, but rest assured that pricing for Reveille will be very reasonable.  To make it easier to decide the right plan for you, we are tailoring our plans to match the capabilities of Backpack's plans.  So, all you'll need to do is choose the plan that matches your Backpack account and you'll be set.</p>
