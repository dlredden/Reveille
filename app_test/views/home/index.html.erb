				<h3 class="faq">I'm not sure what Backpack is</h3>
				<p>Backpack is a web application created by 37signals. As stated on their website, Backpack is a "better way to organize your business". You can share information, and keep your documents, discussions, and schedules in one place. <%= link_to("Go to the Backpack site for more information", "http://backpackit.com/?referrer=WIKIDLABS", :class => "standard") %></p>

			<h3 class="faq">What inspired Reveille?</h3>
			<p>We use 37signal's <%= link_to("Backpack", "http://backpackit.com/?referrer=WIKIDLABS", :class => "standard") %> and <%= link_to("Basecamp", "http://basecamphq.com/?referrer=WIKIDLABS", :class => "standard" ) %> to keep our schedules and projects organized, and we wanted a simple way to see all of our calendar and task data in one place.  So, we set out to solve our own problem.  We thought maybe there were other teams out there with the same problem so we decided to make Reveille available to everyone.</p>
