	<h1>What is Reveille?</h1>
	<p>
		Reveille is a simple app that automatically creates Backpack Reminders for your Backpack Calendar events.
		All you need to do is add a tag for each reminder that you'd like set and Reveille will strip those
		tags out of your calendar item and set the appropriate reminders.
	</p>
	<h1>How will Reveille make my life better?</h1>
	<p>
		With Reveille gluing your Backpack Calendar items to Backpack Reminders you can now get reminders
		anytime you want for any event you want in any way you want. No longer will you be tied down by a very 
		limited 30 minute reminder.
